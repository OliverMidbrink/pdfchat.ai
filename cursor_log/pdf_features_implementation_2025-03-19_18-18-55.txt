# PDFChat.ai PDF Features Implementation Log
Date: 2025-03-19_18-18-55

## Overview
This log documents the implementation of PDF document handling features for the PDFChat.ai application. The features allow users to upload, manage, and chat with PDF documents. The implementation includes database schema updates, backend utilities, API routes, and frontend integration requirements.

## Current Status
- ✅ Database models and relationships have been implemented
- ✅ PDF processing utilities have been created
- ✅ API routes for document management have been added
- ✅ Chat functionality has been updated to include document context
- ❌ Features have not been tested yet
- ❌ Frontend integration is pending

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema Updates

#### 1.1 Models Created
- **Document**: Stores metadata about uploaded PDF documents
  - Linked to User model with foreign key
- **DocumentTextChunk**: Stores extracted text chunks from PDFs
  - Linked to Document model with foreign key
- **conversation_document**: Junction table for many-to-many relationship between conversations and documents

#### 1.2 Database Schema Verification
- All necessary tables exist in the SQLite database (`backend/app.db`)
- Foreign key relationships are properly configured:
  - `documents.user_id` references `users.id`
  - `document_text_chunks.document_id` references `documents.id`
  - `conversation_document.conversation_id` references `conversations.id`
  - `conversation_document.document_id` references `documents.id`
- User model was updated to include relationship with documents:
  ```python
  documents = relationship("Document", back_populates="user", cascade="all, delete-orphan")
  ```

### 2. PDF Processing Utilities

#### 2.1 PDF Processor Implementation (`backend/app/utils/pdf_processor.py`)
- Created a `PDFProcessor` class with functionality for:
  - Saving uploaded PDF files with safe filenames
  - Extracting text from PDFs page by page
  - Chunking extracted text for better processing
  - Searching within document chunks
- Uses PyMuPDF (fitz) library for PDF processing
- Handles file uploads, storage, and text extraction

### 3. API Routes

#### 3.1 Document Management Routes (`backend/app/api/routes/documents.py`)
- GET `/documents`: Retrieves all documents for current user
- GET `/documents/{document_id}`: Fetches specific document details
- POST `/documents/upload`: Handles PDF file uploads
- DELETE `/documents/{document_id}`: Deletes a document
- POST `/documents/{document_id}/add-to-conversation/{conversation_id}`: Associates a document with a conversation

#### 3.2 Chat Routes Update (`backend/app/api/routes/chat.py`)
- Updated to incorporate document context in chat responses
- Checks for documents linked to a conversation
- Builds document context string for the AI assistant
- Preserves conversation history with document references

### 4. Application Updates

#### 4.1 Main Application (`backend/app/main.py`)
- Updated to include document router
- Added code to create uploads directory for PDFs
- Configured static file serving for uploaded files
- Updated application title and description

#### 4.2 Dependencies
- Added PyMuPDF library to `requirements.txt`:
  ```
  pymupdf==1.23.6  # For PDF processing
  ```

### 5. Pydantic Schemas
- Created schemas in `backend/app/schemas/chat.py` for:
  - Document models
  - DocumentTextChunk models
  - Updated conversation schemas to handle documents

## Testing Status
- The application is runnable via `./manage.sh dev`
- Backend and frontend services start successfully
- No actual testing of PDF features has been performed yet
- Potential issues may exist in:
  - File upload handling
  - Text extraction for different PDF formats
  - Document context integration in chat

## Next Steps

### 1. Testing
- Test PDF upload functionality
- Verify text extraction from different PDF types
- Test document-chat integration
- Check conversation creation with documents

### 2. Frontend Integration
- Implement file upload components
- Create document management UI
- Update chat interface to show document context
- Add document selection in conversations

### 3. Error Handling
- Enhance error handling for corrupted PDFs
- Implement better validation for uploaded files
- Add progress indicators for large file uploads

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Review text chunking strategy for large documents
- Consider adding caching for document chunks
- Optimize document search functionality

## Commands and Scripts

### Application Management
- Start development mode: `./manage.sh dev`
- View logs: `./manage.sh logs`
- Stop services: `./manage.sh stop`

### Database
- Current database file: `backend/app.db`
- Database schema is automatically created by SQLAlchemy on startup
- No Alembic migrations are currently set up

### Git Management
- Created `toggle-git-features.sh` script to disable/enable git features in VS Code/Cursor for performance

## Technical Notes
- SQLAlchemy relationships like `relationship()` don't create database columns or constraints - they operate at the ORM level
- The actual database schema is established through the model definitions
- The database doesn't need to be dropped and recreated unless there are issues with the schema

## Potential Issues to Watch
- Large PDF file handling
- Memory usage during text extraction
- Performance impact of including document context in every chat message
- Security of file uploads and storage
- Handling of non-text elements in PDFs
